Ciphers:

1. Ceaser:
To encrypt or decrypt a key is needed. The key is a number - might be positive and negative.
- Encryption:
Given are the plain text and the key.
Each letter of the plain text is shifted "key" position to left or right (depending on whether the number is positive or negative) in the alphabet. The result is the cipher text.
- Decryption:
Given are the cipher text and the key.
Each letter of the plain text is shifted to the opposite direction of the one used for encryption. The result is the plain text.
Note: Only letters are encrypted and decrypted.

2. Route:
To encrypt or decrypt a key is needed. The key is a number - might be positive or negative.
- Encryption:
Given are the plain text and the key.
The plain text is written in a grid with number of columns = key.
If some empty cells are left, they are filled with "X", so that a rectangle is formed.
Next, the letters from the grid are combined following certain route:
- if the key is a positive number, then the route starts from top left corner and it goes downwards and inwards.
- if the key is a negative number, then the route starts from the bottom right corner and it goes upwards and inwards.
The letters in the defined route form the cipher text.
- Decryption:
Given are the cipher text and the key.
An empty grid is created considering thatthe key is the column number and the row number is the lenght of the cipher text divided by the key.
Then following the route (defined by the sign of the key), the letters from the cipher text are placed at the empty grid. The plain text is the obtained text from the created grid.

3. Transposition:
To encrypt or decrypt a key is needed. The key is a number - no matter positive or negative, because its absolute value is used.
- Encryption:
Given are the plain text and the key.
The plain text is written in diagonals in a zig-zag manner to the selected depth (the key).
To obtain the cipher text, the diagonals are read row-by-row.
- Decryption:
Given are the cipher text and the key. 
The cipher text is written in a zig-zag manner to the selected depth (the key).
To obtain the plain text, the diagonals are read as diagonals (column-by-column).

4. Monoalphabetic:
To encrypt or decrypt a key is needed. The key is a text - only letters, no special symbols or digits.
- Encryption:
Given are the plain text and the key.
Duplicate letters are removed from the key and the letters from the alphabet which are not present, are appended to the key in reversed order (cipher pad). 
The cipher text is structured using the cipher pad, the letters corresponding to the plaintext's letter position, are the relevant ones.
- Decryption:
Given are the cipher text and the key.
The cipher pad is created based on the key and the plain text letters are taken from the alphabet based on the position of the cipher text letters in the cipher pad.
Note: The operatons are done with capital letters only.

5. One-time pad:
To encrypt or decrypt a key is needed. The key is a text = only letters, no special symbols or digits.
- Encryption:
Given are the plain text and the key. The key should be with the same size as the plain text, if that's not the case, then "X" are appended to the key.
Each letter from the plain text is summed up with the corresponding one from the key (their indices in the alphabet). The resulted sum is the alphabet position of the ciphered letter.
- Decryption:
Given are the cipher text and the key. The key should be with the same size as the plain text, if that's not the case, then "X" are appended to the key. From each cipher text letter, the corresponding key letter is subtracted (their indices in the alphabet). The result is the index of the alphabter of the relevant plain text letter.
